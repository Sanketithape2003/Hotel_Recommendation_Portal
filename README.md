# Hotel_Recommendation_Portal

he Hotel Recommendation Portal is a dynamic web-based application developed to assist users in finding the most suitable hotels based on their specific preferences. This system allows users to input various criteria such as location, budget, hotel rating, and room type. Based on these inputs, the portal processes and filters the hotel data stored in the backend database and presents a list of recommended hotels that best match the user's requirements.

Developed by a web developer and data analyst, this project demonstrates the integration of user-friendly front-end interfaces with intelligent backend logic to deliver personalized hotel recommendations. It combines clean and responsive web design with logical data-driven decision-making to enhance the travel planning experience. The application leverages PHP and MySQL for backend functionality and uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a modern and responsive user interface.

This project aims to showcase the use of data filtering, user input handling, and real-world problem solving in the hospitality domain, providing a seamless and informative hotel search experience.
