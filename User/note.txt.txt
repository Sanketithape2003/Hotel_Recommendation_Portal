HOTEL RECOMMENDATION PORTAL - USER INSTRUCTION GUIDE

1) DATABASE SETUP:
------------------
Before using the project, make sure to set up the database.

- Open your MySQL server (e.g., phpMyAdmin or any MySQL interface).
- Import the provided SQL file (`hotel_portal.sql`) into your MySQL server.
- This SQL file will create a database named `hotel_portal` (if not already existing) and a table called `reviews` with the following structure:

    Columns:
    - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
    - city (VARCHAR)
    - hotel (VARCHAR)
    - overall_experience (INT)
    - budget (VARCHAR)
    - room_type (VARCHAR)

Make sure the database is properly imported and ready before launching the web application.

2) HOW THE PROJECT WORKS:
--------------------------
This project is divided into two major functional systems:

a) Review System:
   - Users can submit reviews for hotels by filling a simple form.
   - They provide hotel name, city, budget range, room type, and an overall experience rating (e.g., 1â€“5).
   - These reviews are stored in the `reviews` table and used later for recommendation logic.

b) Recommendation System:
   - The system asks users to input their preferences including location (city), budget, desired hotel rating, and room type.
   - It then compares these preferences with the data in the `reviews` table.
   - If matching hotels are found (with rating **equal to or below** the selected rating), they are shown as recommendations.
   - If no hotels are found matching all preferences, the user is informed accordingly.

The logic prioritizes hotels that best align with user preferences using filtering rules, enhancing the decision-making experience for travelers.
